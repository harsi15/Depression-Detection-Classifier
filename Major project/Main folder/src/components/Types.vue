        <h3 class="head2" align="left">Major Depressive Disorder</h3>
        <p align="justify" class="para1">
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Major depressive disorder is the more severe form of depression. It’s characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness that don’t go away on their own.
            In order to be diagnosed with clinical depression, you must experience 5 or more of the following symptoms over a 2-week period:<br>
            <ul>
            <li>Feeling depressed most of the day</li>
            <li>Loss of interest in most regular activities</li>
            <li>Significant weight loss or gain</li>
            <li>Sleeping a lot or not being able to sleep</li>
            <li>Slowed thinking or movement</li>
            <li>Fatigue or low energy most days</li>
            <li>Feelings of worthlessness or guilt</li>
            <li>Loss of concentration or indecisiveness</li>
            <li>Recurring thoughts of death or suicide</li>
            </ul>
        </p><br>
        <h3 class="head2" align="left">Psychotic Depression</h3>
        <p class="para1" align="justify">
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Psychotic depression is a subtype of major depression that occurs when a severe depressive illness includes some form of psychosis. The psychosis could be hallucinations (such as hearing 
            a voice telling you that you are no good or worthless), delusions (such as, intense feelings of worthlessness, 
            failure, or having committed a sin) or some other break with reality. Psychotic depression affects roughly one out of every four people admitted to the hospital for depression<br>
            Common symptoms for patients who have psychotic depression include:
            <ul>
            <li>Agitation</li>
            <li>Anxiety</li>
            <li>Constipation</li>
            <li>Hypochondria</li>
            <li>Insomnia</li>
            <li>Intellectual impairment</li>
            <li>Physical immobility</li>
            <li>Delusions or hallucinations</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="head2" align="left">Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)</h3>
        <p class="para1" align="justify">
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that's related to changes in seasons — SAD begins and ends at about the same times every year. If you're like most people with SAD, your symptoms start in the fall 
            and continue into the winter months, sapping your energy and making you feel moody. Less often, SAD causes depression in the spring or early summer.
            Treatment for SAD may include light therapy (phototherapy), medications and psychotherapy.<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In most cases, seasonal affective disorder symptoms appear during late fall or early winter and go away during the sunnier days of spring and summer. Less commonly, people with the opposite pattern have symptoms that begin in spring or summer.
             In either case, symptoms may start out mild and become more severe as the season progresses.
        </p>
            <h4 class="head3" align="left">Fall and winter SAD</h4>
            <p align="justify" class="para1">
                Symptoms specific to winter-onset SAD, sometimes called winter depression, may include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Oversleeping</li>
                    <li>Appetite changes, especially a craving for foods high in carbohydrates</li>
                    <li>Weight gain</li>
                    <li>Tiredness or low energy</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h4 class="head3" align="left">Spring and summer SAD</h4>
            <p align="justify" class="para1">
                Symptoms specific to summer-onset seasonal affective disorder, sometimes called summer depression, may include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Trouble sleeping (insomnia)</li>
                    <li>Poor appetite</li>
                    <li>Weight loss</li>
                    <li>Agitation or anxiety</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

        <h3 class="head2" align="left">Persistent Depressive Disorder</h3>
        <p class="para1" align="justify">
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A person with persistent depressive disorder (previously referred to as dysthymic disorder)
            has a depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, for at least two years. In children and adolescents, the mood can be irritable or depressed, and must continue for at
            least one year.<br>
            In addition to depressed mood, symptoms include:
            <ul>
                <li>Poor appetite or overeating</li>
                <li>Insomnia or hypersomnia</li>
                <li>Low energy or fatigue</li>
                <li>Low self-esteem</li>
                <li>Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions</li>
                <li>Feelings of hopelessness</li>
            </ul>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The symptoms cause significant distress or difficulty in work, social activities, or other
            important areas of functioning. While the impact of persistent depressive disorder on work,
            relationships and daily life can vary widely, its effects can be as great as or greater than those
            of major depressive disorder.

        <h3 class="head2" align="left">Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder</h3>
        <p align="justify" class="para1">
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) was added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
            of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) in 2013. A woman with PMDD has severe symptoms of
            depression, irritability, and tension about a week before menstruation begins.<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Common symptoms include mood swings, irritability or anger, depressed mood, and marked
            anxiety or tension. Other symptoms may include decreased interest in usual activities,
            difficulty concentrating, lack of energy or easy fatigue, changes in appetite with specific food
            cravings, trouble sleeping or sleeping too much, or a sense of being overwhelmed or out of
            control. Physical symptoms may include breast tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain, a
            sensation of “bloating,” or weight gain.<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These symptoms begin a week to 10 days before the start of menstruation and improve or
            stop around the onset of menses. The symptoms lead to significant distress and problems
            with regular functioning or social interactions. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is estimated to affect between 1.8% to 5.8% of menstruating
            women every year.<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PMDD can be treated with antidepressants, birth control pills, or nutritional supplements. Diet
            and lifestyle changes, such as reducing caffeine and alcohol, getting enough sleep and
            exercise, and practicing relaxations techniques, can help.
