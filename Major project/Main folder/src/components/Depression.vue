      <h3 class="head" align="left">Depression Is Different From Sadness or Grief/Bereavement</h3>
      <p class="para1" align="justify">
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences
            for a person to endure. It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to
            such situations. Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being
            “depressed.”<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and
            unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and
            depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities. They are also
            different in important ways:
            <ul>
                <li>In grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the
                    deceased. In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most
                    of two weeks</li>
                <li>In grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of
                    worthlessness and self-loathing are common</li>
                <li>In grief, thoughts of death may surface when thinking of or fantasizing about “joining”
                    the deceased loved one. In major depression, thoughts are focused on ending one’s life
                    due to feeling worthless or undeserving of living or being unable to cope with the pain
                    of depression</li>
            </ul>
      </p>

      <h3 class="head" align="left">Risk Factors for Depression</h3>
      <p class="para1" align="justify">
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Depression can affect anyone, even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances.
            <br>
            Several factors can play a role in depression:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Biochemistry:</b> Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression</li>
                <li><b>Genetics:</b> Depression can run in families. For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70 percent chance of having the illness sometime in life</li>
                <li><b>Personality:</b> People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression</li>
                <li><b>Environmental factors:</b> Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more vulnerable to depression</li>
            </ul>
