        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Depression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Between 80% and 90% percent of
people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. Almost all patients gain some
relief from their symptoms.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic
evaluation, including an interview and a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test
might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid
problem or a vitamin deficiency (reversing the medical cause would alleviate the depression-like symptoms). The evaluation will identify specific symptoms and explore medical and family
histories as well as cultural and environmental factors with the goal of arriving at a diagnosis
and planning a course of action.

      <p class="para1" align="justify">
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their
        treatment. For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain
        chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-
        forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not
        experiencing depression.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Antidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use yet full
        benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement
        after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or
        substitute another antidepressant. In some situations other psychotropic medications may be
        helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you
        experience side effects.

        <h3 class="head" align="left">Psychotherapy:</h3>
        <p class="para1" align="justify">
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression;
        for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used along with antidepressant
        medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating
        depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the problem solving in the present. CBT helps
        a person to recognize distorted/negative thinking with the goal of changing thoughts and
        behaviors to respond to challenges in a more positive manner.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;        Psychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or
        couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships. Group therapy
        brings people with similar illnesses together in a supportive environment, and can assist the
        participant to learn how others cope in similar situations.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Depending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much longer.
        In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.

        <h3 class="head" align="left">Electroconvulsive Therapy</h3>
        <p class="para1" align="justify">
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(ECT) is a medical treatment that has been most commonly reserved for patients with severe
        major depression who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical
        stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT
        two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. It is usually managed by a team of
        trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or
        physician assistant. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led
        to major improvements and the recognition of its effectiveness as a mainstream rather than a
        "last resort" treatment.
